 * BUTTON:	refers to mouse's button
 * MOTION:	refers to mouse's movement
 * EXPOSE:	refers to the window's gaining focus
 * DESTROY:	refers to the red cross at the upper left corner of the window,
 * 			don't think mlx_close_window can trigger it?
 * 
 * Can't get the rest to trigger, despite some of them would be rather useful.
